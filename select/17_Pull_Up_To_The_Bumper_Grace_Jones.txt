Driving down those city streets
Waiting to get down
Won't you get your big machine
Somewhere in this town?
Now in the parking lot garage
You'll find the proper place
Just follow all the written rules
You'll fit into the space

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up, to it
Don't drive, through it
Back it, up twice
Now that, fits nice

Operate around the clock
Why don't you come in?
I've got lots of space for everyone
Why don't you my friend?
My lines are short, I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on
Shiny sleek machine you wheeled
I've got to blow your horn

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up, to it
Don't drive, through it
Back it, up twice
Now that, fits nice
Grease it, spray it
Let me lubricate it

Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up to my bumper (pull up)
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up to my bumper (pull up)
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up to my bumper (pull up)
Pull up to my bumper
Pull up to my bumper baby
Pull up
