Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor

That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang
[X2]

Yeah, we got God and we got you
Every day thinking about how we get through
Everything I own is on I.O.U.
But I'm here bringing you
Something new

You no like the people, they no like you
Then they go and set it off
With a big boom
Every gun in a battle is a
Son and daughter too

So why you wanna talk about
Who done who?
Why you wanna talk about

That's the M.I.A. tang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang
[X2]

Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the people, pull up the poor
Pull up the poor, pull up the poor

I'm a fighter, fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road
Bring me the reaper
Bring me the lawyer
I'm a fighter, I'll take em on
You treat me like a killer
I ain't never hate ya.

I'm a fighter, fighter God
I'm a soldier on that road
I'm a fighter, a nice nice fighter
I'm a soldier on that road

That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang bang bang

That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you

That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang bang bang

That's the M.I.A. thang
I've got the bombs to make you blow
I got the beats to make you bang
